Euler tour - finger tree or ETFT

The source code included in the present repository was developed by
Juan Carlos Saenz-Carrasco. The aim is to develop and test Euler tour
representation for the linearisation case of  dynamic trees through
functional Finger Trees and Balanced Binary Search Trees.

The code includes a simplified version of finger trees by Hinze's and
Paterson:
http://hackage.haskell.org/package/fingertree
which is based on the paper of the same title
Hinze, R., Paterson, R.: Finger trees: a simple general-purpose data structure.
